# Compiler Design Lab Repository

Welcome to the Compiler Design Lab repository! This repository contains programs and resources related to compiler design, implemented using tools like Lex and Yacc (or Flex and Bison).

## Overview

Compiler design is a fundamental aspect of computer science and software engineering, dealing with the translation of high-level programming languages into machine code. This repository aims to provide practical exercises and examples to understand various concepts and techniques involved in compiler design.

## Programs

The repository includes various programs implemented in Lex/Flex and Yacc/Bison for different phases of compiler design, such as lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, code generation, and optimization. These programs serve as reference implementations to illustrate key concepts and algorithms.

## Contents

- **Lex/Flex Programs:** Contains Lex/Flex programs for lexical analysis, the first phase of a compiler, which involves breaking the input text into a sequence of tokens.
- **Yacc/Bison Programs:** Contains Yacc/Bison programs for syntax analysis, the second phase of a compiler, which involves recognizing the structure of the input text based on a formal grammar.
- **Additional Resources:** Includes documentation, reference materials, sample inputs/outputs, and possibly supplementary code snippets to aid in understanding the concepts and implementing programs.

## Usage

Each program in this repository may have its own directory containing the source code files and any necessary resources. Follow the instructions provided in the respective program's README file to compile and execute the programs.
